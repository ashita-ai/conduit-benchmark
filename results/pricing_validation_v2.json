The problem says \"She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\" We need to use the exchange rates given. The direct exchange for small stickers is: 1 small sticker = 1 small button.\n\nTo get large buttons from small stickers, we'd need to go through an intermediate step or use the small buttons. Let me assume she gets small buttons from small stickers, then trades those for large buttons if possible.\n\n27 small stickers → 27 small buttons\n\nCan we convert small buttons to large buttons? The rate given is \"1 large button = 3 small stickers,\" which means 3 small stickers = 1 large button. So 3 small buttons ≈ 1 large button (assuming small buttons work similarly).\n\n27 small buttons ÷ 3 = 9 large buttons\n\n**After Step 1:**\n- Small stickers: 30 - 27 = 3\n- Large stickers: 40\n- Large buttons: 9\n- Small buttons: 0\n\n**Step 2: Trade 50% of large stickers for large buttons**\n\nLarge stickers traded for large buttons: 50% × 40 = 20 large stickers\n\nExchange: 1 large sticker = 1 large button\nLarge buttons gained: 20\n\n**After Step 2 (first part):**\n- Small stickers: 3\n- Large stickers: 40 - 20 = 20\n- Large buttons: 9 + 20 = 29\n- Small buttons: 0\n\n**Step 3: Trade the remaining 50% of large stickers for small buttons**\n\nRemaining large stickers: 20\n\nExchange: 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons\nSmall buttons gained: 20 × 3 = 60\n\n**Final inventory:**\n- Small stickers: 3\n- Large stickers: 0\n- Large buttons: 29\n- Small buttons: 60\n\n**Total buttons:**\nLarge buttons: 29\nSmall buttons: 60\nTotal: 29 + 60 = 89\n\n#### 89",
