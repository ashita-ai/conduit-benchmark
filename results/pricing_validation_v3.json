This means the remaining fraction of flights is one-quarter (1/4).\nRemaining flights = 1/4 of the total flights\nRemaining flights = (1/4) * 88 = 22 flights.\n\n**Step 3: Calculate the number of flights to France.**\nThe problem states that these remaining 22 flights are split equally between France and Germany. To find the number of flights to France, we divide the remaining flights by 2.\nFlights to France = 22 flights / 2 = 11 flights.\n\n#### 11",

Lorraine's Initial Stickers:**\n*   Small stickers: 30\n*   Large stickers: 40\n\n**3. Trade 90% of Small Stickers for Large Buttons:**\n*   Small stickers traded: 90% of 30 = 0.90 * 30 = 27 small stickers.\n*   To get large buttons from small stickers, the rule is \"A large button is worth three small stickers.\"\n*   Large buttons gained from small stickers: 27 small stickers / 3 small stickers per large button = 9 large buttons.\n\n**4. Trade 50% of Large Stickers for Large Buttons:**\n*   Large stickers traded: 50% of 40 = 0.50 * 40 = 20 large stickers.\n*   According to the rule \"Each large sticker is worth a large button\":\n*   Large buttons gained from these large stickers: 20 large stickers * 1 large button per large sticker = 20 large buttons.\n\n**5. Trade Remaining Large Stickers for Small Buttons:**\n*   Remaining large stickers: 40 (total) - 20 (traded for large buttons) = 20 large stickers.\n*   According to the rule \"Each large sticker is worth ... three small buttons\":\n*   Small buttons gained from these large stickers: 20 large stickers * 3 small buttons per large sticker = 60 small buttons.\n\n**6. Calculate Total Buttons in a Common Unit (Small Buttons):**\n*   Total large buttons acquired: 9 + 20 = 29 large buttons.\n*   Total small buttons acquired: 60 small buttons.\n\n*   To find the total number of buttons as a single value, convert the large buttons to small buttons using the conversion: 1 large button = 3 small buttons.\n*   Value of 29 large buttons in small buttons: 29 large buttons * 3 small buttons/large button = 87 small buttons.\n*   Total buttons (in terms of small buttons) = 87 small buttons + 60 small buttons = 147 small buttons.\n\n147",
