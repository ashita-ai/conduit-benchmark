Calculate large buttons obtained from small stickers:**\nThe rule states \"A large button is worth three small stickers.\"\nSo, 27 small stickers will yield: $27 \\div 3 = 9$ large buttons.\n\n**3. Calculate large stickers traded for large buttons:**\nLorraine starts with 40 large stickers.\nShe trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons: $40 \\times 0.50 = 20$ large stickers.\n\n**4. Calculate large buttons obtained from these large stickers:**\nThe rule states \"Each large sticker is worth a large button.\"\nSo, 20 large stickers will yield: $20 \\times 1 = 20$ large buttons.\n\n**5. Calculate large stickers traded for small buttons:**\nTotal large stickers: 40\nLarge stickers already traded for large buttons: 20\nRemaining large stickers: $40 - 20 = 20$ large stickers.\nThese are traded for small buttons.\n\n**6. Calculate small buttons obtained from these large stickers:**\nThe rule states \"Each large sticker is worth ... three small buttons.\"\nSo, 20 large stickers will yield: $20 \\times 3 = 60$ small buttons.\n\n**7.

So, we can write the equation:\n7x + 11x = 162\n\n**Step 3: Solve for 'x'.**\nCombine the terms with 'x':\n18x = 162\n\nDivide both sides by 18 to find the value of x:\nx = 162 / 18\nx = 9\n\n**Step 4: Calculate Allen's current age.**\nNow that we have the value of 'x', we can find Allen's current age.\nAllen's current age = 11x\nAllen's current age = 11 * 9\nAllen's current age = 99\n\n**Step 5: Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now.**\nThe question asks for Allen's age 10 years in the future. We add 10 to his current age.\nFuture age = 99 + 10\nFuture age = 109\n\nAllen will be 109 years old 10 years from now.\n\n#### 109",

Since the drink is uniform, the spilled portion is also two-thirds water.\n\nWater spilled = 1 × (2/3) = 2/3 liters\n\nRemaining orange drink = 10 - 1 = 9 liters\nWater remaining in orange drink = 20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 liters\n\n## Step 3: Find water in the pineapple drink\nPineapple drink: 15 liters, three-fifths water\nWater in pineapple drink = 15 × (3/5) = 45/5 = 9 liters\n\n## Step 4: Find total water in the mixture\nTotal water = Water from orange drink + Water from pineapple drink\nTotal water = 6 + 9 = 15 liters\n\n## Verification\nTotal liquid = 9 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 24 liters ✓\n\n#### 15",

We need to use the same unit for both measurements. We know that 1 foot is equal to 12 inches.\n\nTotal length in inches = 4 feet × 12 inches/foot\nTotal length in inches = 48 inches\n\n**Step 2: Divide the total length by the length of each piece.**\nNow that we have the total length of the wire in inches, we can divide it by the length of each cut piece to find out how many pieces can be obtained.\n\nNumber of pieces = Total length in inches / Length of each piece in inches\nNumber of pieces = 48 inches / 6 inches\nNumber of pieces = 8\n\nTracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.\n\n#### 8",

There are 3 such numbers.\nThe total number of possible outcomes is 6.\nProbability (greater than 3) = (Number of outcomes greater than 3) / (Total number of outcomes)\nP(>3) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\n**Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row.**\nFirst, let's find the probability of rolling an even number in a single roll.\nThe even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. There are 3 such numbers.\nP(even) = (Number of even outcomes) / (Total number of outcomes)\nP(even) = 3/6 = 1/2 = 0.5\n\nSince the two rolls are independent events, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is the product of the probabilities of rolling an even number on each roll:\nP(two even in a row) = P(even on 1st roll) * P(even on 2nd roll)\nP(two even in a row) = (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4 = 0.25\n\n**Step 3: Compare the two probabilities and express the difference as a percentage.**\nWe want to find out \"how much more likely\" it is to roll a number greater than 3 (P1 = 0.5) than to roll two even numbers in a row (P2 = 0.25). This implies a percentage increase relative to the second probability.\n\nThe difference in probabilities is: P1 - P2 = 0.5 - 0.25 = 0.25.\n\nTo express how much more likely P1 is than P2 as a percentage, we calculate the percentage increase:\nPercentage increase = [(P1 - P2) / P2] * 100%\nPercentage increase = (0.25 / 0.25) * 100%\nPercentage increase = 1 * 100% = 100%\n\nSo, it is 100% more likely.\n\n#### 100",
