Let \\( S \\) be the number of measuring spoons.

This can be expressed as:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{D}{A} = \\frac{7}{11}\n   \\]\n   We can express Darrell's age in terms of Allen's age:\n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{7}{11}A\n   \\]\n\n2. **Set up the total age equation**:\n   We know that the total age of Darrell and Allen combined is 162:\n   \\[\n   D + A = 162\n   \\]\n\n3. **Substitute Darrell's age into the total age equation**:\n   Substitute \\(D\\) from the first step into the second equation:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7}{11}A + A = 162\n   \\]\n\n4. **Combine like terms**:\n   To combine the terms, we need a common denominator. The equation becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7A}{11} + \\frac{11A}{11} = 162\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{7A + 11A}{11} = 162\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{18A}{11} = 162\n   \\]\n\n5. **Multiply both sides by 11** to eliminate the fraction:\n   \\[\n   18A = 162 \\times 11\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   18A = 1782\n   \\]\n\n6. **Solve for A** by dividing both sides by 18:\n   \\[\n   A = \\frac{1782}{18}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   A = 99\n   \\]\n\n7. **Calculate Darrell's age** using \\(D = \\frac{7}{11}A\\):\n   \\[\n   D = \\frac{7}{11} \\times 99\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   D = 63\n   \\]\n\n8. **Verify the total**: \n   \\(D + A = 63 + 99 = 162\\), which is correct.\n\n9. **Calculate Allen's age 10 years from now**:\n   Allen's current age is 99, so in 10 years:\n   \\[\n   A + 10 = 99 + 10 = 109\n   \\]\n\nThe final answer, therefore, is:\n109 [answer]",

Therefore, the number of new children added on the third street can be calculated as follows:\n\n   Each of the 10 existing children gets 2 additional children:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Number of new children on third street} = 10 \\text{ (existing children)} \\times 2 = 20\n   \\]\n\n   Now, we add these new children to the previous total:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total children after third street} = 10 \\text{ (existing)} + 20 \\text{ (new)} = 30\n   \\]\n\n4. **Original Children Leave:**\n   The original 5 children who started following the truck leave the group. Thus, we subtract them from the total:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Total children after original children leave} = 30 - 5 = 25\n   \\]\n\n5. **Final Count:**\n   The total number of children following the truck at the end is:\n\n   \\[\n   \\text{Final number of children} = 25\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n#### 25\n\\]",
