This means her total sleep time for the day would be 5 minutes less than her usual duration, before accounting for sleepwalking.\n    Adjusted sleep duration (before sleepwalking deduction) = 480 minutes - 5 minutes = 475 minutes.\n\n3.  **Calculate the duration of sleepwalking:**\n    Kim was sleepwalking from 2:15 a.m. to 2:38 a.m.\n    Duration of sleepwalking = 2:38 a.m. - 2:15 a.m. = 23 minutes.\n    During this time, she was not on her bed.\n\n4.  **Subtract the sleepwalking time from the adjusted sleep duration:**\n    The question asks for the time she slept *on her bed*. Since she was not on her bed while sleepwalking, we subtract this time.\n    Sleep on bed = 475 minutes (adjusted total sleep time) - 23 minutes (sleepwalking time)\n    Sleep on bed = 452 minutes.\n\n#### 452",

The 3 remaining small stickers can be traded for small buttons:\n- 3 small stickers × 1 small button per sticker = 3 small buttons\n\nLarge buttons total:\n- From step 2: 20 large buttons\n\n**Final count:**\n- Small buttons: 27 + 60 + 3 = 90 small buttons\n- Large buttons: 20 large buttons\n\nIf the question asks for total buttons counting them the same way, I need to determine if we're counting buttons by type or converting to a common unit.\n\nAssuming the question wants total buttons (where large and small are counted separately):\n- Total = 90 small buttons + 20 large buttons\n\nIf we need to express this as a single number treating each button equally:\n- Total buttons = 90 + 20 = 110 buttons\n\n#### 110",

The **second plane** flies only to Poland and makes 44 trips.  \n   We’re told that these 44 trips are **half** the number of trips the first plane makes:\n   \\[\n   44 = \\frac{1}{2}x\n   \\]\n\n3. Solve for \\( x \\):\n   \\[\n   x = 44 \\times 2 = 88\n   \\]\n   So, the first plane makes **88 flights per day**.\n\n4. Now, we use the information about the destinations of the first plane:\n   - Three-quarters of its flights go to Greece: \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\) of 88\n   - The remaining flights (the other quarter) are split **equally** between France and Germany.\n\n5. Compute the number of flights that are **not** to Greece:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flights not to Greece} = 88 - \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88\n   \\]\n   First calculate \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 \\):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3}{4} \\times 88 = 3 \\times 22 = 66\n   \\]\n   Then:\n   \\[\n   88 - 66 = 22\n   \\]\n   So there are **22 flights** total that are split between France and Germany.\n\n6. These 22 flights are split **equally** between France and Germany:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Flights to France} = \\frac{22}{2} = 11\n   \\]\n\n#### 11",

Since the orange drink is uniformly mixed, the spilled liter also contains two-thirds water.\n\nWater spilled = 1 × (2/3) = 2/3 liters\n\n## Step 3: Calculate water in the remaining orange drink\nRemaining orange drink = 10 - 1 = 9 liters\nWater in remaining orange drink = 20/3 - 2/3 = 18/3 = 6 liters\n\n(Or alternatively: 9 × (2/3) = 6 liters)\n\n## Step 4: Calculate water in the pineapple drink\nPineapple drink: 15 liters, three-fifths water\nWater in pineapple drink = 15 × (3/5) = 45/5 = 9 liters\n\n## Step 5: Calculate total water in the mixture\nTotal water = Water from orange drink + Water from pineapple drink\nTotal water = 6 + 9 = 15 liters\n\n## Verification\nTotal mixture = 9 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) = 24 liters ✓\n\n#### 15",
