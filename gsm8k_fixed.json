We can write the equation:\n\\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \\]\n\nCombining the terms on the left side of the equation, we have:\n\\[ 18x = 162 \\]\n\nTo find \\(x\\), we divide both sides by 18:\n\\[ x = \\frac{162}{18} = 9 \\]\n\nThus, \\(x = 9\\).\n\nNow, to find Allen's current age, substitute \\(x = 9\\) into the expresion for Allen's age \\(11x\\):\n\\[ 11x = 11 \\times 9 = 99 \\]\n\nSo, Allen is currently 99 years old.\n\nTo find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:\n\\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \\]\n\nTherefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be:\n#### 109",

Let's solve this problem step by step to find out how many buttons Lorraine has by the end of the trading.\n\nGiven:\n- Each large sticker is worth a large button or three small buttons.\n- A small sticker is worth one small button.\n- A large button is worth three small stickers.\n- Lorraine starts with 30 small stickers and 40 large stickers.\n- She trades 90% of her small stickers for large buttons.\n- She trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons and trades the rest of them for small buttons.\n\nStep 1: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.\n90% of 30 small stickers = 0.9 × 30 = 27 small stickers\n\nStep 2: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine receives from trading small stickers.\n27 small stickers ÷ 3 = 9 large buttons\n\nStep 3: Calculate the number of large stickers Lorraine trades for large buttons.\n50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 × 40 = 20 large stickers\n\nStep 4: Calculate the number of large buttons Lorraine receives from trading large stickers.\n20 large stickers = 20 large buttons\n\nStep 5: Calculate the number of large stickers Lorraine trades for small buttons.\nRemaining large stickers = 40 - 20 = 20 large stickers\n\nStep 6: Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine receives from trading large stickers.\n20 large stickers × 3 = 60 small buttons\n\nStep 7: Calculate the number of small stickers Lorraine has left.\nRemaining small stickers = 30 - 27 = 3 small stickers\n\nStep 8: Calculate the number of small buttons Lorraine receives from trading remaining small stickers.\n3 small stickers = 3 small buttons\n\nStep 9: Sum up the total number of buttons Lorraine has by the end.\nTotal buttons = Large buttons (from small stickers) + Large buttons (from large stickers) + Small buttons (from large stickers) + Small buttons (from small stickers)\nTotal buttons = 9 + 20 + 60 + 3 = 92 buttons\n\nTherefore, Lorraine has 92 buttons by the end of the trading.\n\n#### 92",
