Recall from the problem statement:\n- Each large sticker is worth a large button or 3 small buttons.\n- Thus, 27 small stickers are equal to \\( \\frac{27}{3} = 9 \\) large buttons.\n\n### Remaining Stickers After First Trade\n- Small stickers: \\( 30 - 27 = 3 \\) small stickers left.\n- Large stickers: 40 (no change yet).\n\n### Step 2: Trading large stickers\nNext, Lorraine trades 50% of her large stickers for large buttons.\n- 50% of 40 large stickers = 0.5 × 40 = 20 large stickers are traded.\n\nEach large sticker is worth either 1 large button or 3 small buttons. In this case, she trades the 20 large stickers for large buttons.\n- Lorraine receives 20 large buttons from the trade.\n\n### Remaining Stickers After Second Trade\n- Small stickers: 3 small stickers (no change).\n- Large stickers: \\( 40 - 20 = 20 \\) large stickers left.\n\n### Step 3: Trading remaining large stickers\nLorraine now trades the remaining 20 large stickers. She trades these for small buttons.\nSince each large sticker is worth 3 small buttons, trading 20 large stickers would yield:\n- 20 large stickers × 3 small buttons per large sticker = 60 small buttons.\n\n### Summary of All Trades\n1. Small buttons from small stickers: 9 large buttons (from trading small stickers).\n2. Large buttons from large stickers (first 50% traded): 20 large buttons.\n3. Small buttons from remaining large stickers: 60 small buttons.\n\n### Total Buttons Calculation\n- Total buttons = large buttons + small buttons.\n- Total buttons = 9 (large) + 20 (from large stickers) + 60 (small) = 89 buttons.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n#### 0089 [89]",
