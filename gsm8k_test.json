The problem says she trades \"for large buttons\" but doesn't directly state what a small sticker is worth in terms of large buttons. Let me re-read the given exchange rates:\n- 1 large sticker = 1 large button OR 3 small buttons\n- 1 small sticker = 1 small button\n- 1 large button = 3 small stickers\n\nFrom \"1 large button = 3 small stickers,\" I can infer that 1 small sticker would be worth 1/3 of a large button. However, since we can't trade fractions, let me reconsider.\n\nActually, looking more carefully: if a small sticker is worth 1 small button, and we need to know what it's worth in large buttons, I should work backwards. Since 1 large button = 3 small stickers, then 3 small stickers = 1 large button.\n\nSo: 3 small stickers = 1 large button, which means 1 small sticker ≈ 1/3 large button.\n\nBut the problem asks about trading stickers \"for large buttons\" - perhaps she can only trade in valid whole units. Let me assume she trades small stickers at the rate of 3 small stickers = 1 large button.\n\n**Trade 1 (revised): 90% of small stickers for large buttons**\n- Small stickers traded: 30 × 0.90 = 27\n- Small stickers remaining: 30 - 27 = 3\n- Exchange: 3 small stickers = 1 large button\n- Large buttons received: 27 ÷ 3 = 9 large buttons\n\n**Trade 2: 50% of large stickers for large buttons**\n- Large stickers to trade: 40 × 0.50 = 20\n- Large stickers remaining: 40 - 20 = 20\n- Exchange: 1 large sticker = 1 large button\n- Large buttons received: 20 × 1 = 20 large buttons\n\n**Trade 3: Remaining 50% of large stickers for small buttons**\n- Large stickers traded: 20\n- Exchange: 1 large sticker = 3 small buttons\n- Small buttons received: 20 × 3 = 60 small buttons\n\n**Final inventory:**\n\nSmall buttons:\n- From trade 1: 0 (she traded small stickers, not for small buttons)\n- From trade 3: 60\n- Already had: 3 small stickers (remaining, but these are stickers, not buttons)\n\nWait, I need to clarify: after the trades, does she still have the 3 remaining small stickers? Let me track what she has:\n\nAfter all trades:\n- Small stickers remaining: 3\n- Large stickers remaining: 0\n- Large buttons: 9 + 20 = 29\n- Small buttons: 60\n\nThe question asks \"How many buttons does she have by the end?\" This asks specifically for buttons, not stickers.\n\nTotal buttons = Large buttons + Small buttons = 29 + 60 = 89\n\n#### 89",
